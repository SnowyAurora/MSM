This Music School Management Software, or MSMS, currently runs only within a terminal, without a graphic GUI. 
The Search function as of currently is also case sensitive, as currently I am unable to find a satisfactory method of implementing a case insensitive search using just python's default library.

To run this program, please install version 3.13.5. Any bugs resulting from running on an unsupported version of python will not be looked into and fixed. You should run the MSMS.py file, as MAIN.py is an empty file solely for git committance (and I currently do not know how to make MSMS.py the main file.)
