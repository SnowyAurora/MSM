### README FIRST BEFORE USAGE ###
This program should be run using Python 3.15.5. Other types of python are untested and unsupported, and any bugs resulting from running on an unsupported version will be IGNORED.

This program saves to a json file called msms.json. While it is capable of regenerating this file, it will NOT be able to only save in memory.

The "Remove" function for BOTH Teachers AND Students will NOT allow you to reassign the same id to a newly created database object. This feature will not be implemented due to it being far too time consuming for little reward.

The "Time stamp" function is formatted strangely and I am currently incapable of deciphering how best to lay it out in a human readable way. It will remain this way for the forseeable future.

The "print student ID" function is buggy and generally will very likely print weirdly. Bugfixing it has already cost more than 3 hours of work, which I am not looking to spend more time on. Advice : Do not use unless you must.
